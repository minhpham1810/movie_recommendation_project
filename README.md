# Weather Prediction App

This project is a weather prediction application that uses Apache Spark for data processing and machine learning, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The app predicts temperatures based on historical weather data and displays the predictions along with actual data in both tables and graphs.

# Features

- Loads and preprocesses historical weather data.
- Creates lagged and rolling average features.
- Trains a Random Forest model to predict temperatures.
- Displays the actual and predicted temperatures in a table and line graph.
